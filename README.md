# NK Academy

## Welcome ;)

<p>This is a web page developed for a real gym that I attended. It was developed with the aim of providing an additional way of publicizing all the details of the gym.</p>

<p>The following technologies were used to create this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>React JS</li>
  <li>Typescript</li>
  <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
  <li>Vite</li>
  <li>npoint.io</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a demonstration of the project:</p>
